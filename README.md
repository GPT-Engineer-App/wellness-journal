# wellness-journal

I'm interested in building out a personal health dashboard to organize my own personal health information. 
This should include all elements typically found in a comprehensive EHR system, such as personal health history, family health history, medications, diagnoses, providers, clinics, hospitalizations, surgeries, and insurance policies. 
This should also include a function to monitor daily health metrics (I.e., weight, symptoms, dietary intake, mood, etc.) and track them over time (including the ability to add/edit/delete entries as appropriate).
